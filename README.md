# detect-fake-ig

This repository contains a demonstration of how to develop and train a model to
identify fake social media accounts.

This is meant for reserach and hobby purposes only. Scrape social media data at
your own risk.

**Next Steps**

+ Host model in a webapp (perhaps flask)
+ Allow users to use one or two models to classify their own input
+ Add feature importance/shap values to demonstrate what factors into
  classification decisions
